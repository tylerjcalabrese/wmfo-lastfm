# WMFO last.fm Scrobbler
By Tyler Calabrese
February 2022

Scrobbles the tracks currently listed on the WMFO homepage to the given
last.fm account.

User will need their own last.fm API account (key and secret). Please
create a .env file with 'API_KEY', 'API_SECRET', 'USERNAME', and 
'HASHED_PASS' before running the application.

My next goal is to allow scrobbling a show on the current week's
schedule as an alternative to just the WMFO homepage. So, after listening
to a WMFO show in its entirety, users could conveniently scrobble all of
the songs played.
